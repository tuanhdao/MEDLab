# MEDLab

This repository includes all of my work for the MED Lab: Modified version of Island Getaway using code written by https://github.com/Kodiologist (Kujawa et al., 2014), script to pull behavioral data from the task and trigger code delay fix, and data cleaning tools (odd/even and BVA macro process).
